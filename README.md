# Atl-Food-Finder
This was done as a group assignment for a course. I was in a group of 5 and led backend development.
I was also scrum master for the agile scum development process. This project is written in Django and uses the Google API.
The code provided will NOT run any functions reliant on the Google API since the key is not provided. 
To see the full functionality, visit our demonstration site: https://kenzieelle4.wixsite.com/atl-eats-demo
Note that the files here are just the key edits we made. To actually view all code in the proper hierachy, you will need to download the zip file and extract.
